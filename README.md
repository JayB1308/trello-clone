# Trello Clone

## Steps to run:
- Clone the repo to your local machine.
- Go to the directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the application, go to `localhost:3000` to see the application. The link will be available in the terminal as well.
- To run tests, run `npx cypress open`, the cypress application will run, click on `Component Testing` > `Select the browser` > `Select the spec you want to run`

## Preloaded Date:
I have preloaded some data to make it easier to test the application:
- User: `username`:`JayB`, `password`:`JayB12`
- Project: The project `A project`, has some preloaded tasks to test the drag and drop functionality.

**NOTE: This is preloaded data, feel free to use the application and add more.**

### Libraries Used:
- redux
- react-router-dom
- tailwindcss
- react-dnd
- react-hook-form
- react-icons
- react-hot-toast
  
The application is made using `typescript` and `vite` as module bundler.
